# Contributing to milo-blocks

Want to contribute? Great!
- First, read this page
- Second, please make pull requests against develop, not master. If your patch
  needs to go into master immediately, include a note in your PR.

For more information on style guide and other details, head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/4and4/MiloServer/wiki).

### Larger changes
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.
